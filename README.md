## AppProdigy: Empowering AI with Internal Product Knowledge

**AppProdigy** is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to bridge the knowledge gap between AI coding assistants (like Copilot, Cursor, etc.) and your organization's proprietary applications and internal product portfolio.

**Problem:** AI assistants often struggle with generating accurate code or functional insights for internal, undocumented, or rapidly evolving applications, leading to "hallucinations" and outdated suggestions.

**Solution:** AppProdigy acts as a real-time knowledge base. When prompted, it intelligently retrieves and injects up-to-date, version-specific functional documentation and key features of your internal applications directly into the AI's context window.

**Key Features:**

* **Context-Aware AI:** Provides your AI coding assistant with the precise, relevant information it needs about your company's custom software (e.g., Legal Matter Management, CRM, HR Payroll).

* **Reduces Hallucinations:** Minimizes incorrect or outdated code suggestions by grounding the AI in your actual product knowledge.

* **Boosts Developer Productivity:** Accelerates development by ensuring AI-generated code and explanations are accurate and aligned with your internal systems.

* **Flexible Knowledge Integration:** Designed to integrate with various internal documentation sources (Markdown files, wikis, databases, or RAG systems).

* **Built on MCP:** Leverages the open Model Context Protocol for seamless integration with compatible AI clients and IDEs (e.g., VS Code).

**Get Started:** Integrate AppProdigy into your development workflow to supercharge your AI assistant's understanding of your unique codebase. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
